//! \addtogroup 0007 Pathfinding
//! \brief A pathfinding module
//!
//! A pathfinding module that can be used in the R2D2 project.
//! The module is currently based on the A star algorithm.
//!
//! \file   AStarPathFinder.hpp

//! \brief  Implementation of the pathfinder interface
//!
//! Takes a starting point and end point and a reference to a path.
//! If a path is possible it returns a path to the end point. If no path is
//! possible it will return false.
//! This implementation uses A* for the search, which is defined in the
//! "Astar" class.
