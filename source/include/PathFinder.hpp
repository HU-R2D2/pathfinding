//! \brief A pathfinding module
//!
//! A pathfinding module that can be used in the R2D2 project.
//! The module is currently based on the A star algorithm.

//! \brief  Find the path and returns the path
//!
//! Takes a starting point and end point and a reference to a path.
//! If a path is possible it returns a path to the end point. If no path is
//! possible it will return false.
